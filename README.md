🎮 Simon Says Game
📌 About the Project

The Simon Says Game is a classic memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project is designed as a beginner-friendly mini project to help understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic using JavaScript.

In this game, the system generates a sequence of colors, and the player must repeat the sequence in the correct order. With each successful round, the sequence becomes longer, making the game more challenging and engaging.
